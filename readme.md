3. take a piece of bread while the butter is melting and cut it like this
but use a knife instead of a spoon lol
![bread](bread.jfif)
4. quickly after mix the eggs in the bowl for ~ 30 seconds ( till its completely yellow liquid )

6. just wait till its done, make sure to use a spatula to go underneath when it's half solid so it doesnt stick ( do it every x seconds)
7. just wait till its done and add seasoning enjoy!
